        <h3>‚ôø The Road to Recovery</h3>
        <p>Recovering from a stroke is a different journey for everyone, so there's no set timeframe for how long it will take. Because different parts of the brain can be affected, recovery is very individual.</p>
        <p>We will have a team of specialists to support you. This will include physiotherapists to help you build your strength and movement back up in your affected arm and leg. They will give you a personalised programme with exercises you can do. We'll also involve speech and language therapists to help with any speaking difficulties, and occupational therapists who can help with adjustments at home to make daily life easier.</p>
        <p>It's also important to know that it's very common to experience psychological effects like anxiety or depression after a stroke. This is completely understandable, and we have support available if these feelings persist.</p>
        <p>In terms of going home, patients often stay in hospital for about a week, but this depends on how you are progressing and if any care needs to be arranged at home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>‚ù§Ô∏è Lifestyle Changes to Reduce Future Risk</h3>
        <p>There are several important lifestyle changes you can make to significantly reduce your risk of having another stroke. Quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do for your health. Reducing your alcohol intake will also help.</p>
        <p>A healthy, balanced diet is very important. We can refer you to a dietician for support with this. When you feel ready, gentle exercise like swimming is excellent for your overall health.</p>
        <p>Many people take months off work to recover, but this is a personal decision between you and your employer when you feel ready. It's also safe to have sex after a stroke; it does not increase your risk of having another one.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>üíä Medications for Secondary Prevention</h3>
        <p>To help prevent another stroke, we will start you on a few medications. Firstly, a high-dose statin, which works to lower the 'bad' cholesterol in your blood. We will also look at your blood pressure and start medication to control it, as high blood pressure can damage blood vessels.</p>
        <p>Finally, we will continue the anti-platelet drugs you were started on. These are medications like aspirin and clopidogrel that make your blood less sticky and reduce the chance of another clot forming.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>üöó Driving and Other Considerations</h3>
        <p>It's a legal requirement to inform the DVLA that you have had a stroke. You will not be able to drive for at least one month. After that period, if you feel ready, you will need an assessment with your GP to check your vision and physical function before you can be considered safe to drive again.</p>
