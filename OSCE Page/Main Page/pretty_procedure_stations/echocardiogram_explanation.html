    <h3>üìö Knowledge</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An echocardiogram (echo) is an ultrasound scan of the heart and nearby blood vessels.</li>
        <li>Used to assess heart structure, function, chamber sizes, wall motion, and valve competency.</li>
        <li>Indicated post-MI, in suspected heart failure, murmurs, arrhythmias, or unexplained breathlessness.</li>
        <li>Shows the ejection fraction ‚Äì a key measure of left ventricular function.</li>
        <li>Painless, non-invasive, uses no radiation, and takes ~15‚Äì30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Patient lies on their side while a probe (with gel) is applied to the chest.</li>
        <li>No specific preparation needed; outpatient basis; no risks or recovery time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>‚úÖ Strategy &amp; summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Clearly explain what an echo is, how it's done, and its purpose.</li>
        <li>Provide reassurance ‚Äì painless, no radiation, short duration.</li>
        <li>Check ICE ‚Äì especially concerns about heart failure.</li>
        <li>Emphasize benefits: clarifying symptoms like breathlessness or fatigue.</li>
        <li>Correct misunderstandings (e.g. heart failure not only due to prior MI).</li>

    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script üìú</h2>

    <h3>üìö Knowledge</h3>

    <h4>‚ùì What is an echocardiogram?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "An echocardiogram is a jelly scan of your heart and the nearby blood vessels."</p>
        <p>"The scanner uses sound waves or 'echos' to make a picture, so there's no radiation."</p>
        <p>"We will be able to see the 4 chambers of the heart, including the valves."</p>
        <p>"We are looking to see that all parts of the heart are pumping efficiently and that the valves aren't leaky."</p>
        <p>"We can also look at the size of your heart, and calculate how much blood it is pumping."</p>
        <p>"The procedure is generally quite quick and takes 15-30 minutes."</p>
        <p>"There are no complications to this procedure and it isn't painful."</p>
        <p>"You'll have this procedure as an outpatient, which means you don't have to stay in hospital, instead you can go home straight after."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>üí° Why an echocardiogram is needed</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Sometimes after a heart attack, the heart doesn't pump as well as it used to, or valves might become leaky."</p>
        <p>"When this happens, people get symptoms such as breathlessness and wheeziness, such as you have."</p>
        <p>"When someone gets symptoms, like breathlessness, because their heart isn't pumping as well as it used to, it's known as heart failure."</p>
        <p>"We want to make sure that all parts of the heart are moving and pumping efficiently and that the valves aren't leaky."</p>
        <p>"We also want to look at the size of your heart, and calculate how much blood it is pumping."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>‚ù§Ô∏è What is heart failure?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Heart failure is where your heart isn't pumping as effectively."</p>
        <p>"There are lots of causes of heart failure, including heart attacks, irregular heart rhythm, heart valve problems or murmurs, and high blood pressure."</p>
        <p>"It's quite common in your age group, with about 10% of people over 70 having heart failure."</p>
        <p>"Heart failure causes symptoms like breathlessness, tiredness, fainting, needing to sleep on more pillows, and a chronic cough."</p>
        <p>"We classify heart failure that has been going on a long time by the amount of blood pumped by one of the chambers of the heart, called the left ventricle. This is called your left ventricle ejection fraction."</p>
        <p>"However, you can also classify heart failure by symptoms and effect on life."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>üí¨ Exploration &amp; empathy</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Do you have any questions about the scan or why it's being done?"</p>
        <p>Provide reassurance and check for misunderstandings.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>‚úÖ Strategy and summary</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Could you please summarise back to me the key points to ensure I‚Äôve explained everything clearly?"</p>
        <p>Confirm understanding about the procedure, purpose, and implications.</p>
