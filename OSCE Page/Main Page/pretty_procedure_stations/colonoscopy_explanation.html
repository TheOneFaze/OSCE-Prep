    <h3>üìö Knowledge</h3>

    <h4>‚ùì What is a colonoscopy?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "A colonoscopy is a procedure to look inside your large bowel using a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end, inserted through your bottom."</p>
        <p>"We pump air into the bowel to open it up so we can get a clear view. This might make you feel bloated or have an urge to open your bowels."</p>
        <p>"The procedure usually takes around 30 to 45 minutes."</p>
        <p>"Your bowel needs to be empty for the colonoscopy to be effective, which is why you'll need to take laxatives or have an enema beforehand."</p>
        <p>"We'll provide you with information leaflets and the medications needed for preparation."</p>
        <p>"After the procedure, you‚Äôll be taken to the recovery room and monitored until you‚Äôre ready to go home. If you have sedation, you must arrange for someone to take you home."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>ü©∫ What is the at-home testing kit for?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "The at-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is offered to people aged 54 to 74 in England."</p>
        <p>"It detects small amounts of blood in stool that are not visible to the naked eye."</p>
        <p>"If blood is detected, it could be a sign of bowel cancer or other conditions, and you will be referred for a colonoscopy."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>‚ùì What can cause blood in stool?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Blood in the stool can be caused by several conditions. The most serious is bowel cancer."</p>
        <p>"Other causes include stomach or bowel ulcers, diverticular disease, hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn‚Äôs or ulcerative colitis, polyps, or spontaneous bleeding."</p>
        <p>"Any blood in stool is abnormal and should be investigated."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>‚ùì Why is a colonoscopy needed?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Your at-home test showed blood in your stool, so we want to look inside your bowel to check for any problems."</p>
        <p>"Many people have normal colonoscopies, but polyps, which can be pre-cancerous growths, are common especially as people get older."</p>
        <p>"If we find polyps or suspicious areas, we‚Äôll take small biopsies to be examined under a microscope. The results usually take a few weeks."</p>
        <p>"We will explain any findings on the day of the procedure."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Complications of colonoscopy</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "You might feel bloated and pass wind after the procedure, which usually settles within a few hours."</p>
        <p>"Some patients have stomach cramps, which can be relieved with painkillers."</p>
        <p>"A small amount of blood from your bottom after the procedure is common, but large amounts or clots are not normal."</p>
        <p><em>"In rare cases, colonoscopy can cause a tear (perforation) in the bowel, which requires urgent medical attention."</em></p>
        <p><em>"There is also a small risk of infection or bleeding."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Colonoscopy is safe but not 100% perfect; some cancers or polyps can be missed."</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>üí¨ Exploration &amp; empathy</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Do you have any questions or concerns about the colonoscopy?"</p>
        <p>Offer reassurance and clarify any doubts.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>‚úÖ Strategy and summary</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Could you summarise the main points we‚Äôve covered to make sure everything is clear?"</p>
        <p>Confirm understanding about procedure, preparation, risks, and follow-up care.</p>
