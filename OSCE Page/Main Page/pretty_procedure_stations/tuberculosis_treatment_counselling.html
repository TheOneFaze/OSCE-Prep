        <li>TB is a serious bacterial disease primarily affecting the lungs but can spread to other organs.</li>
        <li>Treatment is essential to prevent complications and disease spread.</li>
        <li>Standard treatment lasts ~6 months using 4 drugs: rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol.</li>
        <li>Initial 2 months: all four drugs; subsequent 4 months: rifampicin and isoniazid only.</li>
        <li>Public health notification is required; close contacts may need screening.</li>
        <li>Common side effects include orange bodily fluids (rifampicin), neuropathy (isoniazid), joint pain and liver toxicity (pyrazinamide), vision problems (ethambutol).</li>
        <li>Monitoring includes liver function tests and vision assessments.</li>
        <li>Patients are infectious for approximately 2 weeks after starting treatment; self-isolation is advised.</li>
        <li>Adherence to medication is critical to prevent drug resistance and treatment failure.</li>

    <h3>üìö Knowledge</h3>

    <h4>‚ùì What TB is and why it should be treated</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Tuberculosis is a serious bacterial disease, primarily affecting the lungs but potentially spreading to other parts of the body like the kidneys, nerves, stomach, and heart if left untreated."</p>
        <p>"It‚Äôs very important to treat TB to prevent these complications and to stop the infection spreading to others."</p>
        <p>"Because of your penicillin allergy, we avoid penicillin-based antibiotics and use alternative medications."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>üïí General information on TB treatment</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Treatment usually lasts about six months and involves taking four different antibiotics: rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol."</p>
        <p>"For the first two months, you take all four medications. After that, you continue with just rifampicin and isoniazid for the remaining four months."</p>
        <p>"I am required to notify public health authorities, who may contact your close contacts for screening."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Adverse drug reactions (ADRs)</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "These medications can have side effects which you should be aware of."</p>
        <p>"Rifampicin can cause your sweat, urine, and tears to turn orange ‚Äî this is harmless but can be surprising."</p>
        <p>"Isoniazid may cause nerve-related symptoms, so we also give vitamin B6 to reduce this risk."</p>
        <p>"Pyrazinamide can cause joint pains, including gout, and liver toxicity."</p>
        <p>"Ethambutol can affect your vision, so we will test your eyesight before and during treatment."</p>
        <p>"If you experience any concerning side effects, please contact us immediately. I can also provide detailed written information for you."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>ü©∫ Monitoring</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "We will monitor your liver function through blood tests, and regularly check your vision to detect any early problems."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>ü¶† Infection control and compliance</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "You will remain infectious for about two weeks after starting treatment."</p>
        <p>"During this time, it‚Äôs important to avoid contact with vulnerable people such as children, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals."</p>
        <p>"Self-isolation is advised to prevent spread."</p>
        <p>"Adhering to your treatment regimen is crucial, even if you start feeling better early, to avoid developing drug-resistant TB."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>üí¨ Exploration &amp; empathy</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "How do you feel about the information I have provided?"</p>
        <p>Address any concerns or emotional distress, especially regarding the length of treatment and self-isolation.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>‚úÖ Strategy and summary</h3>
    <h4>üìù Patient summary</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Could you please summarise the treatment plan we've discussed to ensure I've explained everything clearly?"</p>
        <p>Confirm patient understands the duration, medications, side effects, monitoring, and infection control measures.</p>
