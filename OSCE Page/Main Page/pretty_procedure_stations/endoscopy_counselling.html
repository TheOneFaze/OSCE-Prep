    <h3>üìö Knowledge</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Endoscopy (OGD) examines oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum via a thin flexible tube with a camera through the mouth.</li>
        <li>Used to investigate symptoms like dyspepsia and abnormal blood tests.</li>
        <li>Procedure takes 20-45 minutes; fasting for 6 hours prior is required.</li>
        <li>Numbing spray used to throat; sedation may be offered for comfort.</li>
        <li>Air is insufflated into stomach to improve visualization, causing mild discomfort or burping.</li>
        <li>Possible biopsy may be taken, which is painless.</li>
        <li>Post-procedure: avoid driving/operating machinery for 24 hours if sedated.</li>
        <li>Wait at least 1 hour before eating/drinking after throat numbing spray to avoid choking risk.</li>
        <li>Causes of dyspepsia include hiatus hernia, gastric cancer (rare), and bacterial infections like H. pylori.</li>
        <li>Complications are rare but include perforation, bleeding, infection, and sedative side effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>‚úÖ Strategy &amp; summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain procedure clearly with reassurance about pain and sedation.</li>
        <li>Discuss fasting and post-procedure precautions.</li>
        <li>Highlight common causes being investigated.</li>

    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script üìú</h2>

    <h3>üìö Knowledge</h3>

    <h4>‚ùì What is endoscopy and what does it involve?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "This procedure, called an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy or OGD, allows us to look inside your oesophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine."</p>
        <p>"We do this because of your symptoms and abnormal blood tests to ensure there is no serious underlying issue."</p>
        <p>"You'll come into hospital where a thin, flexible tube with a camera will be passed down your throat into your stomach and duodenum."</p>
        <p>"You might feel the tube going down but it shouldn't be painful. We'll spray your throat with a numbing agent and may give you sedation to help you relax."</p>
        <p>"Air will be gently pumped into your stomach to improve visibility, which may cause you to feel bloated or make you burp."</p>
        <p>"If necessary, we may take small tissue samples (biopsies) during the procedure, which you won't feel."</p>
        <p>"It's important not to eat for at least six hours before the procedure to ensure your stomach is empty."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>üïí After the endoscopy</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "If you've had sedation, you shouldn't drive or operate heavy machinery for 24 hours afterwards."</p>
        <p>"You'll be monitored in recovery until the sedation wears off."</p>
        <p>"If only a throat spray was used, wait at least an hour before eating or drinking to prevent choking."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>‚ùì What can cause dyspepsia?</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Common causes include hiatus hernia, where part of the stomach pushes into the chest area."</p>
        <p>"Though rare, we need to rule out stomach cancer."</p>
        <p>"Sometimes, dyspepsia can be caused by bacterial infections such as Helicobacter pylori."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Complications of endoscopy</h4>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "You might feel bloated or gassy for a few hours after."</p>
        <p>"Some people experience stomach cramps, but painkillers can help."</p>
        <p>"You may notice a small amount of blood from your throat, but larger amounts or clots are abnormal and should be reported."</p>
        <p>"Though very rare, there's a small risk of perforation, which would need surgery."</p>
        <p>"There is also a slight risk of infection or reactions to sedation."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>üí¨ Exploration &amp; empathy</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Do you have any questions about the procedure or what we are looking for?"</p>
        <p>Provide reassurance and address any concerns.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>‚úÖ Strategy and summary</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> "Could you please summarise back to me the key points to ensure I‚Äôve explained everything clearly?"</p>
        <p>Confirm understanding about the procedure, preparation, risks, and follow-up.</p>
