    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>

    <h3>🩺 Opening the consultation</h3>
    <p>“Hi, I’m [Your Name], a medical student. I’ve been asked to go over the results of your recent blood tests. Before we start, could I confirm your name and date of birth?”</p>
    <p>“Today, I’ll be explaining your diagnosis and answering any questions you may have.”</p>

    <h3>📋 Patient History</h3>
    <p>“Before we go into the diagnosis, can I ask about the symptoms that brought you in? Any increased thirst, frequent urination, tiredness?”</p>
    <p>“Do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications regularly?”</p>
    <p>“Is there a family history of diabetes or other illnesses?”</p>
    <p>“Can you tell me a bit about your living situation and daily activities?”</p>
    <p>“What kind of work do you do?”</p>
    <p>“Do you smoke or drink alcohol?”</p>
    <p>“How would you describe your usual diet?”</p>

    <h3>💬 Ideas, Concerns & Expectations</h3>
    <p>“What do you know about type 2 diabetes?”</p>
    <p>“Do you have any concerns or questions about this diagnosis?”</p>
    <p>“What are you hoping to get out of today’s consultation?”</p>

    <h3>🍩 Explanation</h3>
    <p>“I’d like to start by briefly explaining how your body normally regulates blood sugar.”</p>
    <p>“When you eat, your body breaks down food into sugar (glucose), which enters your bloodstream. Your pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps move sugar from the blood into your cells to be used for energy.”</p>
    <p>“In type 2 diabetes, your body either doesn’t produce enough insulin, or your cells become resistant to it. This causes sugar to build up in your blood.”</p>
    <p>“This condition can develop gradually and is more common with increasing age, excess weight, and family history.”</p>
    <p>“If not managed well, high blood sugar can damage organs like the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and increase risk of heart disease.”</p>
    <p>“Our goal is to keep your blood sugar within a safe range to reduce these risks.”</p>
    <p>“Management involves lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and medication. We usually start with a medicine called metformin to help your body use insulin better.”</p>

    <h3>❓ Patient Questions</h3>
    <p>“You’ll have regular blood tests every few months to check your average blood sugar (HbA1c), and also checks for blood pressure, kidney function, eyes and feet.”</p>
    <p>“At this stage, you don’t need to check your blood sugar at home routinely, unless we advise otherwise.”</p>

    <h3>🔚 Closing the consultation</h3>
    <p>“To summarise, you have type 2 diabetes. It’s a manageable condition with lifestyle and medication, and we’ll support you every step of the way.”</p>
    <p>“Here is a leaflet with information about your condition and how to manage it.”</p>
    <p>“If you ever feel very tired, dizzy, confused, or unwell — especially if you start medications — please contact us or attend A&E as it may indicate low or high blood sugar.”</p>
    <p>“Do you have any questions for me?”</p>
    <p>“Thank you for your time. We’ll arrange a follow-up appointment soon.”</p>
    <p>“I will now safely remove my PPE and wash my hands.”</p>

    <h3>💡 Key Communication Skills</h3>
    <p>Throughout the consultation, I will ensure active listening, summarise key points to check understanding, and clearly signpost the flow of information.</p>
