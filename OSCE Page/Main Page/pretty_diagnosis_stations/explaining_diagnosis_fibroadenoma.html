    <h3>Set up</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>🧼 Wash hands and PPE</li>
        <li>👩 Introduce self, name, role</li>
        <li>🆔 Confirm patient identity</li>
        <li>🗣️ Clarify consultation purpose</li>
        <li>📁 Aware of background: first triple assessment, first presentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding & Concerns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>💭 Ask what patient knows about breast lumps or fibroadenomas</li>
        <li>😟 Explore concerns, especially about cancer</li>
        <li>💬 Use ICE framework (Ideas, Concerns, Expectations)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>

    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>
    <h3>🩺 Introduction</h3>
    <p>“Hi, I’m [Your Name], a medical student. I’ve been asked to talk to you about your recent breast clinic visit. Can I confirm your name and date of birth?”</p>
    <p>“Today, I’ll explain the results and answer your questions. Is that okay?”</p>

    <h3>📖 Background</h3>
    <p>“I understand you’ve had a triple assessment for a lump in your breast — and this is your first time being investigated for something like this, is that right?”</p>

    <h3>🔍 Understanding & Concerns</h3>
    <p>“Can I ask, what do you already know about the lump?”</p>
    <p>“Do you have any concerns, particularly about it being cancer?”</p>

    <h3>🎀 What is a Fibroadenoma?</h3>
    <p>“A fibroadenoma is a benign (non-cancerous) breast lump. It doesn’t increase your risk of cancer.”</p>
    <p>“It’s like a collection of normal breast tissue that’s just grown differently — almost like a breast mole. They’re most common in younger women under 30.”</p>

    <h3>🔬 How was it Diagnosed?</h3>
    <p>“You’ve had a triple assessment: a clinical exam, an ultrasound/mammogram, and possibly a biopsy. These confirmed it’s a fibroadenoma.”</p>

    <h3>🛠️ Management Options</h3>
    <p>“In most cases, we just monitor it — especially if it’s not causing issues.”</p>
    <p>“If it becomes painful, grows, or you’d like it removed, a minor operation is possible.”</p>

    <h3>💬 Empathy & Support</h3>
    <p>“How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed so far?”</p>
    <p>“It’s completely normal to feel anxious even when the news is reassuring.”</p>

    <h3>📎 Summary & Safety Netting</h3>
    <p>“So to summarise, you have a benign fibroadenoma. No treatment is needed unless it causes problems.”</p>
    <p>“We’ll give you a leaflet, and if anything changes — like a new lump, pain, or skin changes — please come back.”</p>

    <h3>✅ Final Check</h3>
    <p>“Just to make sure I’ve explained everything clearly, could you summarise in your own words what you’ve understood?”</p>
    <p>“Do you have any other questions?”</p>
    <p>“Would you like anyone else to be in the room or speak to someone further?”</p>
    <p>“Thanks very much for your time!”</p>
