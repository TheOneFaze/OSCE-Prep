    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>

    <h3>🩺 Introduction</h3>
    <p>"Hi, I’m [Your Name], a medical student. I’ve been asked to talk to you about the results of your recent kidney function tests. Could I confirm your full name and date of birth?"</p>
    <p>"Today I’ll explain what chronic kidney disease is, what your results mean, and how we manage it going forward."</p>
    <p>"Is it okay if we proceed with this discussion now? Would you like anyone else to be present during our conversation?"</p>

    <h3>🔍 Understanding & Concerns</h3>
    <p>"Have you heard of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, before?"</p>
    <p>"Is there anything in particular that you’re concerned about — such as dialysis, life expectancy, or dietary changes?"</p>
    <p>(Pause here to allow questions and check understanding.)</p>

    <h3>🩻 What is Chronic Kidney Disease?</h3>
    <p>"CKD means your kidneys aren’t working as well as they used to. It’s usually a gradual process and is picked up on routine blood or urine tests."</p>
    <p>"We measure it using something called eGFR, which gives us an estimate of your kidney function. We also check for protein in your urine and monitor your blood pressure regularly."</p>
    <p>(Pause to check understanding and clarify any doubts.)</p>

    <h3>⚠️ What Are the Risks?</h3>
    <p>"In early stages, you may not notice any symptoms. But if it worsens, it can cause tiredness, fluid retention, or higher risks of heart problems."</p>
    <p>"Our goal is to slow the progression and reduce any complications."</p>

    <h3>🛠️ How Do We Manage It?</h3>
    <p>"The most important steps are managing blood pressure and any related conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol. We often use medications like ACE inhibitors or statins to protect your kidneys."</p>
    <p>"We also advise drinking enough fluids, reducing salt intake, avoiding over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen, and staying on top of your blood tests and reviews."</p>

    <h3>📋 Monitoring and Support</h3>
    <p>"You’ll have regular check-ups to monitor your bloods, blood pressure, and symptoms. If kidney function falls further, we might refer you to a specialist team — but many people live for years with stable CKD."</p>

    <h3>🗣️ Correcting Misunderstandings</h3>
    <p>"If you have any concerns or ideas about the condition that don’t seem quite right, please let me know so I can clarify."</p>

    <h3>📚 Additional Resources</h3>
    <p>"I can provide you with leaflets and direct you to trustworthy websites and support groups to help you understand more."</p>

    <h3>✅ Summary & Safety Net</h3>
    <p>"So in summary, CKD means your kidney function is a bit reduced. It’s common, especially with age, high blood pressure or diabetes — and we can manage it well with medication and lifestyle changes."</p>
    <p>"Here’s a leaflet with everything we discussed. If you ever notice swelling, breathlessness, or changes in urine, please let us know immediately."</p>
    <p>"Do you have any questions about what we discussed today?"</p>

    <h3>🤝 Shared Decision Making & Follow-up</h3>
    <p>"Let’s agree on a plan that you feel comfortable with, and we’ll arrange regular monitoring to keep things under control."</p>

    <p>"Thanks for your time — we’ll keep monitoring things and support you with regular reviews."</p>
