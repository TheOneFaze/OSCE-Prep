    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>

    <h3>🩺 Introduction</h3>
    <p>"Hi, I'm [Your Name], a medical student. I’ve been asked to talk to you about your blood pressure results. Before we start, could I confirm your name and date of birth?"</p>
    <p>"Today I’d like to explain what high blood pressure means, how we manage it, and answer any questions you might have."</p>

    <h3>🔍 Understanding & Concerns</h3>
    <p>"Do you know much about high blood pressure?"</p>
    <p>"Is there anything you're worried about or hoping I can clear up today?"</p>

    <h3>💓 What is Hypertension?</h3>
    <p>"Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of your arteries. When it’s consistently too high, it’s called hypertension."</p>
    <p>"You may not feel unwell with it, but over time it puts extra strain on your heart, blood vessels, brain and kidneys, which increases the risk of things like strokes, heart attacks, kidney problems and eye damage."</p>

    <h3>📊 What Causes It?</h3>
    <p>"There isn’t always a single cause, but it can be linked to age, genetics, being overweight, a high-salt diet, lack of exercise, smoking, or alcohol." </p>

    <h3>🛠️ How Do We Manage It?</h3>
    <p>"We usually start with lifestyle changes. These include reducing salt, eating more fruits and vegetables, regular exercise, weight loss, and stopping smoking if you smoke."</p>
    <p>"If your blood pressure is still high after these, or if it's very high to begin with, we may recommend medication. This could include ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics — depending on your age and other health conditions."</p>

    <h3>📋 Monitoring and Targets</h3>
    <p>"You’ll have regular blood pressure checks, either at the GP surgery or with a home monitor. We aim to keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg for most people, or even lower if you have diabetes or kidney disease."</p>

    <h3>✅ Summary & Safety Net</h3>
    <p>"So in summary, hypertension is high blood pressure that can cause serious problems over time. It can be managed effectively with a combination of lifestyle changes and medication."</p>
    <p>"Here’s a leaflet with everything we discussed and tips to help at home. If you ever get symptoms like chest pain, vision changes, or severe headaches — please seek urgent medical attention."</p>
    <p>"Do you have any questions or anything you’d like me to go over again?"</p>
    <p>"Thanks for your time — and we’ll arrange a follow-up with your GP or practice nurse soon."</p>
