    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>
    <h3>🩺 Set up</h3>
    <p>"Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I’m a medical student. I will be talking with you today about your recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Before we start, could you please confirm your full name and date of birth?"</p>
    <p>"The purpose of this consultation is to explain what atrial fibrillation is, how we manage it, and to answer any questions you might have. Is that okay with you?"</p>
    <p>"Do I have your consent to proceed?"</p>
    <h3>🔍 Perceptions</h3>
    <p>"Can you tell me what you already know or have been told about atrial fibrillation?"</p>
    <p>"What concerns or expectations do you have about this condition?"</p>
    <p>"Please feel free to ask questions or stop me at any time if you want me to explain something more clearly."</p>
    <h3>💡 Invitation</h3>
    <p>"Would you like me to go over all the details about atrial fibrillation, or are there specific areas you want me to focus on?"</p>
    <p>"Is there anyone else you would like to have with you while we discuss this?"</p>
    <h3>🫀 Knowledge</h3>
    <p>"Atrial fibrillation, or AF, is a common heart rhythm disorder. Normally, your heart beats in a regular and controlled way. However, in AF, the upper chambers of your heart, called the atria, beat irregularly and often very quickly because of abnormal electrical signals."</p>
    <p>"This irregular heartbeat may cause symptoms like palpitations, feeling tired, dizziness, or breathlessness. Sometimes people don’t notice any symptoms, and AF is found during routine checks."</p>
    <p>"One common cause of AF is high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, which can affect the heart's structure and function."</p>
    <p>"It’s important to manage AF because it increases the risk of stroke. Blood can pool in the atria and form clots, which can then travel to the brain."</p>
    <h3>🛠️ Management</h3>
    <p>"Treatment focuses on two main goals: preventing strokes and controlling the heart rhythm or rate."</p>
    <p>"To prevent strokes, we usually prescribe blood thinning medications called anticoagulants, such as apixaban or rivaroxaban."</p>
    <p>"To control your heartbeat, there are two approaches: rate control, which slows the heart rate using medications like beta blockers, and rhythm control, which aims to restore a normal heart rhythm through medications or procedures like cardioversion."</p>
    <h3>📋 Lifestyle and Monitoring</h3>
    <p>"We also recommend lifestyle changes, such as reducing alcohol and caffeine intake, managing your blood pressure and weight, and avoiding stimulants that can trigger AF."</p>
    <p>"You might need regular ECG monitoring and follow-up appointments with your cardiologist to manage this condition effectively."</p>
    <h3>✅ Summary & Safety Net</h3>
    <p>"To summarise, atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm that increases your risk of stroke, but with proper treatment including anticoagulation and heart rate or rhythm control, we can manage this risk."</p>
    <p>"If you experience chest pain, severe dizziness, fainting, or worsening symptoms, please seek urgent medical attention."</p>
    <p>"Here is a leaflet summarising what we discussed today. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?"</p>
    <p>"Thank you for your time. Your GP or cardiologist will be in touch with the next steps."</p>
    <h3>🤝 Closing</h3>
    <p>"Is there anything else you would like to know or talk about before we finish?"</p>
