    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>
    <h3>🩺 Set up</h3>
    <p>“Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I’m a medical student. I’ve been asked to talk to you about your recent diagnosis. Before we start, can I confirm your full name and date of birth?”</p>
    <p>“To begin, could I ask what symptoms brought you in and if you’ve ever had anything like this before?”</p>

    <h3>🔍 Exploring Understanding & Concerns</h3>
    <p>“What do you know about asthma so far?”</p>
    <p>“Do you have any worries or questions at this stage?”</p>
    <p>“Is there anything you’re particularly hoping to get out of today’s consultation?”</p>

    <h3>🫁 What is Asthma?</h3>
    <p>“Asthma is a very common lung condition. It affects the small tubes inside your lungs, making them inflamed and sensitive. This means they can narrow when triggered, making it hard to breathe.”</p>
    <p>“Symptoms may include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. These symptoms often come and go in response to triggers such as pollen, infections, or cold air.”</p>

    <h3>⚠️ Complications & Red Flags</h3>
    <p>“Occasionally, asthma can flare up into what’s called an ‘asthma attack’. If you’re ever very breathless, your inhaler doesn’t help, or you can’t talk in full sentences, you should call 999 immediately.”</p>

    <h3>💊 Treatment and Inhalers</h3>
    <p>“You will be given an inhaler, with the type dependent on the severity of your asthma. This is used to both help relieve asthma symptoms and asthma attacks and help in the long-term to reduce inflammation in your airways.”</p>
    <p>“You should inhale … (x doses … x times a day) every day. It is really important to try not to miss any doses.”</p>
    <p>“You should take an extra (x doses) when you feel short of breath, up to a maximum of (x doses) a day.”</p>
    <p>“If your asthma is well-controlled you should not have significant symptoms during the day or night or limitations on activities. If you are experiencing any of these, you should request a review of your asthma with your GP.”</p>
    <p>“You should also make sure to rinse out your mouth after using the inhaler as you can sometimes develop a sore, inflamed mouth when taking it.”</p>

    <h3>📏 Peak Flow & Plans</h3>
    <p>“You’ll also be given a peak flow meter. This measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs and helps monitor your asthma at home.”</p>
    <p>“You’ll also have a personalised asthma management plan to guide you on what to do if symptoms worsen.”</p>

    <h3>📅 Ongoing Management</h3>
    <p>“You should aim for yearly reviews with your GP, keep up with your flu and COVID vaccines, and avoid smoking or other irritants.”</p>

    <h3>✅ Closing</h3>
    <p>“So today we’ve covered what asthma is, how it’s treated, and what signs to look out for. Do you have any questions?”</p>
    <p>“Here’s a leaflet with everything we’ve discussed. You’ll also be booked for an inhaler technique review and an asthma management plan check.”</p>
    <p>“Thanks for your time, and take care!”</p>
