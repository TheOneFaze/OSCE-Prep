            <li>Acknowledge the patient feels well and the result may be unexpected.</li>

    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>ðŸ’¬ Delivering the Result</h3>
        <p>"Thank you for your patience. I've calculated your average blood pressure reading, and it is 141 over 87."</p>
        <p>"Now, I know you mentioned you feel perfectly well, so a number like this might seem surprising. This reading is a little higher than the ideal range, and it falls into a category we call hypertension."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>ðŸ¤” Explaining What It Means</h3>
        <p>"It's very important to understand that a one-off check like this is just a snapshot in time. It doesn't automatically mean you need to start medication. Think of it as an early warning sign that we need to look into things more formally."</p>
        <p>"The reason we monitor blood pressure is that if it remains high over a long period, it can increase the future risk of conditions like heart attacks or strokes. The great news is that it's very manageable."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>ðŸ“‹ Outlining the Next Steps</h3>
        <p>"So, what happens next? Because this reading is high, the correct next step is for me to refer you to your GP for a proper assessment. I will send these results directly to your surgery today, so they will have them on file."</p>
        <p>"Your GP will likely want you to wear a small, portable machine for 24 hours that checks your blood pressure automatically as you go about your normal day. This gives a much more accurate picture of your average blood pressure."</p>
        <p>"Only after that will your doctor decide if any treatment is needed, and that decision will be based on those results and your overall health."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>ðŸŒ³ Lifestyle Management</h3>
        <p>"You asked if there was anything you could do yourself, and the answer is absolutely yes. In fact, lifestyle changes are the most important first step for managing blood pressure."</p>
        <p>"Things that make a big difference include aiming for 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week - like a brisk 30-minute walk five times a week. Reducing your salt intake is also key; try to avoid adding salt to food and check labels on processed foods. Limiting alcohol to no more than 14 units a week is also recommended."</p>
    </div>
     <div class="section-box">
        <h3>âœ… Summary & Closing</h3>
        <p>"So, to summarise: today's reading was high, so I am referring you to your GP. They will likely arrange a 24-hour monitor to investigate further. In the meantime, the lifestyle changes we discussed are a fantastic and powerful way for you to start taking control."</p>
        <p>"Here is a leaflet with more information on those lifestyle tips. Do you have any other questions for me right now?"</p>
