    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>üí¨ Opening the Consultation</h3>
        <p>"Hello, I‚Äôm [Your Name], one of the doctors here. I understand you've come in today to talk about quitting smoking. That's a fantastic and positive step to take, so well done for coming in."</p>
        <p>"To make sure I give you the best advice, could you tell me a bit about what you were hoping to get from our chat today, and what you've tried in the past?"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>ü§î Exploring Motivation & Triggers</h3>
        <p>"Thank you for sharing that. It‚Äôs very common to try quitting 'cold turkey', and it's a real challenge. Your reasons for quitting‚Äîfor your children and your own health‚Äîare incredibly powerful motivators that we can build on."</p>
        <p>"You mentioned you tend to smoke on your drive to work and during breaks with colleagues. Recognising these specific triggers is a key part of the process, as we can plan alternatives for those moments."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>‚≠ê Planning with the STAR Method</h3>
        <p>"Instead of just stopping, I recommend a more structured approach that we call the 'STAR' method. It helps prepare you for success."</p>
        <p>"'S' is for <strong>Set</strong> a quit date, ideally in the next couple of weeks. 'T' is for <strong>Tell</strong> your family and friends so they can support you. 'A' is for <strong>Anticipate</strong> challenges, like what to do during a stressful day at work instead of a cigarette. And 'R' is for <strong>Remove</strong> all your tobacco products from your home and car."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-box">
        <h3>üíä Discussing Therapies</h3>
        <p>"You asked about medications, and you're right, they can significantly increase your chances of quitting for good. We also know that combining medication with behavioural support, like counselling, is the most effective strategy."</p>
        <p>"The main options are Nicotine Replacement Therapy, or NRT‚Äîthings like patches or gum‚Äîwhich help manage the withdrawal symptoms. There are also tablets like Varenicline or Bupropion which work on the brain pathways involved in craving."</p>
        <p>"I can also refer you to a local Stop Smoking Service. They offer brilliant one-to-one support and can help you stay on track."</p>
    </div>
     <div class="section-box">
        <h3>‚úÖ Summary & Follow-Up Plan</h3>
        <p>"So, to summarise, we can use the STAR method to create a clear plan. We can choose a therapy that you feel comfortable with to help manage cravings, and I can connect you with a local support service."</p>
        <p>"How about we set a quit date for two weeks from now? We can decide on a medication today and get that prescribed. Then, we must book a follow-up appointment for a week or two after your quit date to see how you're getting on and support you through any challenges."</p>
        <p>"How does that sound as a plan to start with?"</p>
