<h2>Full OSCE Script 📜</h2>
<h3>🩺 Set up</h3>
<p>"Hello, my name is [Your Name], I'm one of the doctors. I'll just wash my hands and put on PPE if needed. Can I confirm your name and date of birth?"</p>
<p>"I understand you’ve recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Today, I'd like to discuss a medication called an ACE inhibitor that can help control this. Is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Before we begin, is it okay if we talk about your options and answer any questions you have?"</p>

<h3>💭 Perceptions (ICE)</h3>
<p>"Can I ask what you already know about high blood pressure or ACE inhibitors? Any worries or questions about treatment? What are you hoping for today?"</p>
<p>"Please feel free to ask questions at any point."</p>

<h3>📨 Invitation</h3>
<p>"Would you like a general overview, or is there anything specific about blood pressure or ACE inhibitors you’d like to know? Anything you’d prefer not to talk about?"</p>

<h3>📚 Knowledge & Explanation</h3>
<p>"ACE inhibitors help relax your blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood and helping to lower your blood pressure. That helps protect your heart, kidneys, and blood vessels in the long term."</p>
<p>"You might not feel any different, but over time this reduces your risk of heart attacks, strokes, and kidney problems."</p>
<p>"It’s important to take the medication daily, around the same time. You may need to take it for the long term."</p>
<p>"Common side effects include a dry, persistent cough—this isn’t dangerous but can be annoying. Much more rarely, you could get sudden swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat, which is serious—stop the medication and seek urgent help if this happens."</p>
<p>"Other side effects can include feeling dizzy (especially when you first start), or high potassium levels—so we monitor your blood tests."</p>
<p>"Before starting, we’ll check your kidney function and potassium, and repeat these bloods 1–2 weeks after starting. You’ll also have periodic checkups."</p>
<p>"Alongside medication, lifestyle changes really help: eat less salt, drink less alcohol, exercise, and keep a healthy weight."</p>
<p>"Would you like a leaflet or web links for more info?"</p>

<h3>🫶 Empathy, Exploration & Summary</h3>
<p>"How do you feel about everything I’ve said? Is there anything you’d like me to repeat or explain again?"</p>
<p>"Just to check, could you tell me what you’ll do if you develop a persistent cough or swelling of your lips/tongue/throat?"</p>
<p>"Does this plan sound reasonable for you? Any other questions?"</p>
<p>"If you get swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, or a severe cough, stop the medication and seek help immediately."</p>
<p>"Thank you for your time. I’ll remove PPE and wash my hands."</p>
