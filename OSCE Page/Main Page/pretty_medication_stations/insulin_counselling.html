<h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>

<h3>🩺 Set up</h3>
<p>"Hi, my name is [Your Name], I’m a medical student. I’ll just wash my hands and put on some PPE. Can I confirm your full name and date of birth?"</p>
<p>"I see you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, and today we’ll discuss your treatment options, especially insulin. Is this a good time to talk, and is there anything in particular you want to focus on?"</p>
<p>"Before we get started, can I ask what you already know about diabetes or insulin? Are there any worries or expectations you’d like to share?"</p>

<h3>💉 What is insulin and why do you need it?</h3>
<p>"Insulin is a hormone your body needs to move sugar from your blood into your cells. In type 1 diabetes, your body can’t make insulin at all; in some type 2 cases, there’s not enough or it doesn’t work properly, so we replace it with injections."</p>
<p>"Would you like a detailed explanation of how insulin works, or just the essentials?"</p>

<h3>🖊️ How to use insulin</h3>
<p>"Insulin is injected just under the skin using a small needle—usually in your tummy or thigh. It's important to rotate where you inject to avoid thickened skin. There are different types—some are taken once or twice daily (basal), and others are taken before meals (bolus). We’ll show you exactly what you need and can practice together using a demo pen."</p>

<h3>⚠️ Side effects & safety</h3>
<p>"The most important risk is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). You may feel shaky, sweaty, dizzy, or confused. If this happens, treat it with something sugary like glucose tablets or juice. Always carry hypo treatment with you. Rarely, insulin can cause swelling in your legs or feet."</p>
<p>"If you drive, you need to inform the DVLA, as insulin can cause hypos and affect driving safety."</p>

<h3>🩸 Monitoring & storage</h3>
<p>"You’ll need to check your blood sugars before meals and at bedtime. We’ll also check your HbA1c every 3–6 months. Store unopened insulin in the fridge, and once in use, it can stay at room temperature for up to 28 days, but never freeze it."</p>

<h3>🫂 Empathy, feelings & shared decision-making</h3>
<p>"How do you feel about starting insulin? It’s normal to feel nervous, and we’ll support you as you get used to it. We’ll make a plan together that works for you. If anything isn’t clear, just ask."</p>

<h3>✅ Summary & teach-back</h3>
<p>"Just to check I’ve explained things clearly, could you tell me the main points you’ll remember about using insulin? If anything’s unclear, I can go over it again."</p>
<p>"Have all your questions been answered? If you have any worries, you can always contact your diabetes team. Thank you for your time today!"</p>
<p><b>Safety netting:</b> "If you notice frequent hypos or other side effects, please contact your team. Always carry hypo treatment, especially when out or driving."</p>
