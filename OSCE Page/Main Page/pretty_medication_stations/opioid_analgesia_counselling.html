<!-- Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script Section -->
<div class="content-section" id="fullScript">
    <h2>Full OSCE Script (Covers All Checklist Points) 📜</h2>
    <h3 class="section-title">🩺 Set up</h3>
    <p>“Hello, my name is [Your Name], I’m one of the medical students today. Before we start, can I wash my hands and put on some PPE? Thank you.”</p>
    <p>“Could I please confirm your full name and date of birth?”</p>
    <p>“I understand you’ve been struggling with long-term knee pain. Today, I’d like to talk with you about ways to manage this pain, especially the use of strong painkillers called opioids, and some alternative options. Is that alright with you?”</p>
    <p>“Before we begin, is it okay if we discuss your history briefly and then go through the different options together?”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">🗣️ Brief History</h3>
    <p>“Could you tell me a bit about your knee pain? Has anything changed recently—any swelling, redness, fevers, or sudden worsening?”</p>
    <p>“Have you tried any other treatments so far—like paracetamol, ibuprofen, or creams?”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">💡 Perceptions & Concerns</h3>
    <p>“Just before we go into the details, can I check what you already know about osteoarthritis and strong painkillers like opioids?”</p>
    <p>“Are you worried about anything in particular with your pain, or about taking new medicines?”</p>
    <p>“Please feel free to ask questions or stop me at any time—this is your consultation.”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">📖 Invitation</h3>
    <p>“Would you like me to explain more about osteoarthritis and how opioids work, or is there something specific you want to focus on?”</p>
    <p>“Is there any area you do not wish to discuss today? And would you like anyone else in the room with you before we proceed?”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">🦵 Knowledge: OA & Opioids</h3>
    <p>“Osteoarthritis is a common joint condition where the cushioning in the knee wears down over time. It causes pain, stiffness, and sometimes swelling, usually worsening with activity.”</p>
    <p>“Treatments start with things like gentle exercise, weight loss if needed, and simple painkillers like paracetamol or anti-inflammatory creams.”</p>
    <p>“Now, opioids are a group of strong painkillers, such as codeine, tramadol, morphine and others. They’re useful for short-term severe pain or cancer pain, but have important risks.”</p>
    <p>“The biggest concerns with opioids are tolerance (the effect wears off), dependence (the body gets used to them), and even addiction. Side effects can include drowsiness, constipation, sickness, and—at high doses—dangerous breathing problems.”</p>
    <p>“Because of these risks, opioids aren’t recommended for long-term joint pain like osteoarthritis, as they don’t treat the underlying cause and the risks outweigh any benefit.”</p>
    <p>“Instead, we recommend safer options: topical creams (like capsaicin), physiotherapy, steroid injections, or referral to a rheumatologist for further assessment.”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">📚 Extra Info & Patient-Friendly Terms</h3>
    <p>“I’ll do my best to explain things simply, but please let me know if anything isn’t clear. I can also give you written info, links to reliable websites, or support group contacts if you’d find that useful.”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">🤝 Exploration & Empathy</h3>
    <p>“How do you feel about what we’ve discussed? I completely understand that pain is frustrating and impacts your daily life. We want to help you manage it safely and effectively.”</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">✅ Strategy & Summary</h3>
    <p>“Just to check we’re on the same page—could you tell me what your main takeaways from our discussion are?”</p>
    <p>“Do you feel all your questions have been answered, or is there anything else you’d like to discuss?”</p>
    <p>“We’ll decide the next step together, whether that’s trying a cream, getting referred to rheumatology, or something else you’re happy with.”</p>
    <p>“If your pain changes suddenly, gets much worse, or if you notice new swelling, fevers, or can’t move the joint, please seek medical help straight away.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you for your time—here are some leaflets and details of support groups. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you need further advice.”</p>
