<h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>
<h3>🩺 Set up</h3>
<p>"Hi, my name is [Your Name], I’m one of the doctors. I’ll just wash my hands and put on PPE if needed. Can I confirm your full name and date of birth?"</p>
<p>"Your recent diagnosis is atrial fibrillation, and today we’ll talk about the treatment options—especially blood thinners like apixaban, which are used to reduce your stroke risk. Is that okay with you? Shall we carry on?"</p>

<h3>💭 Perceptions (ICE)</h3>
<p>"What do you already know about atrial fibrillation and its treatments? Do you have any concerns or questions about blood thinners? What are you hoping to get from our chat today?"</p>
<p>"Feel free to ask anything as we go—this is your decision."</p>

<h3>📨 Invitation</h3>
<p>"Would you like me to give an overview of AF and its treatments, or is there something specific you’d like to focus on? Is there anything you’d prefer not to hear about?"</p>

<h3>📚 Knowledge & explanation</h3>
<p>"AF means your heart has an irregular rhythm, which increases the chance of blood clots forming. These clots can cause a stroke. Blood thinners, or anticoagulants, like apixaban, help stop clots from forming and so lower your risk of stroke."</p>
<p>"Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). It makes your blood less likely to clot, but it also means you may bleed more easily. Does that make sense so far?"</p>
<p>"I’ll explain in small steps—let me know if I’m going too fast or if you want more detail."</p>

<h3>💊 How to take Apixaban</h3>
<p>"Apixaban is usually taken twice a day, at the same time each day. You can take it with or without food. If you miss a dose, just take the next one at your usual time—don’t double up."</p>
<p>"You’ll usually need to stay on it long-term, unless your doctor says otherwise."</p>

<h3>🩺 Timeline & monitoring</h3>
<p>"We’ll check your kidney function with a blood test before and during treatment, and see you at least once a year for review."</p>

<h3>⚠️ Side effects & safety netting</h3>
<p>"The main risk is bleeding, like bruising more easily, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or stool. If you notice severe, persistent, or unexplained bleeding, or black stool or severe headache, seek urgent help."</p>
<p>"Avoid taking NSAIDs or aspirin unless your doctor says so, as they increase bleeding risk."</p>

<h3>🤝 Empathy, exploration, and summary</h3>
<p>"How do you feel about this information so far? Any concerns, or is there something you’d like to go over again?"</p>
<p>"To summarise: Apixaban reduces your risk of stroke from AF, but increases bleeding risk. Take it twice a day, don’t double up on missed doses, and look out for bleeding. We’ll review you regularly. Can you tell me what you’ll remember or do if you miss a dose, or if you notice bleeding?"</p>
<p>"Here’s a leaflet and some web links for more info. Have I answered all your questions? Thank you for your time—I’ll take off PPE and wash my hands."</p>
