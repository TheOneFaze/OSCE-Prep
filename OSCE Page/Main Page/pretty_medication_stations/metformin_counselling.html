    <h2>Full Word-for-Word OSCE Script 📜</h2>

    <h3>🩺 Set up</h3>
    <p>"Hi, I’m [Your Name], a medical student. I’ll wash my hands and put on some PPE if needed. Can I confirm your name and date of birth?"</p>
    <p>"I see you’ve recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and have been started on metformin. Is it alright if I talk you through what this medicine does, how to take it, and what to look out for?"</p>
    <p>"What do you know about metformin already, or do you have any concerns about starting it?"</p>

    <h3>💊 What is metformin and why do you need it?</h3>
    <p>"Metformin is a tablet that helps your body respond better to insulin and reduces the amount of sugar your liver makes. It’s usually the first tablet offered for type 2 diabetes."</p>
    <p>"It may also help with weight loss and long-term diabetes complications."</p>

    <h3>🕒 How to take metformin</h3>
    <p>"You’ll usually start with a low dose, like 500mg once a day, and increase gradually. Always take it with food to reduce stomach upset and try to take it at the same time each day."</p>

    <h3>⚠️ Side effects and safety</h3>
    <p>"The most common side effects are tummy upset—nausea, diarrhoea, or cramps. These usually settle over time. Rarely, metformin can affect your kidneys or cause a serious condition called lactic acidosis, which is why we check your kidney function before starting and every year."</p>

    <h3>📝 Monitoring & follow-up</h3>
    <p>"We’ll check your kidney function before starting, then at least once a year. You’ll also have regular diabetes reviews and foot checks."</p>

    <h3>🔁 Missed dose</h3>
    <p>"If you miss a dose, just take it when you remember, unless it’s close to your next one—then skip it. Never double up to make up for a missed dose."</p>

    <h3>🫂 Empathy & summary</h3>
    <p>"It’s normal to have questions or worries starting a new medicine. Would you like a leaflet or website about metformin and diabetes? Can you tell me what you’ll remember about how to take metformin, just to check I explained it clearly?"</p>
    <p>"Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish? Thank you for your time!"</p>
